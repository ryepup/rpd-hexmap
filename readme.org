#+TITLE: hex map
* drawing
** DONE define hex map in terms of rows/columns, calculate multiplier from there
   CLOCK: [2010-07-05 Mon 17:11]--[2010-07-05 Mon 18:04] =>  0:53
Also split out x vs y multiplier
* modeling
** use cl-graph to model the hexmap
 1. after drawing

    build up row/column and x/y for each hex, then loop over building vertex/edges afterwards?

 2. before drawing
    use the row/col limits to generate the graph first, then walk the graph to draw the map?

* interaction
** highlight a hex on mouseover
** highlight hexes with a given radius
* source code
** refactor in /src folder
** use unwind-protect in with-hexmap
** tests?
** logging framework
